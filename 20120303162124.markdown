#dot files

So , i'm trying to get my head around these "dot files" that are created as GH repo's by people. 

AFAIK , the dotfiles are stored in the ~ directory which are read by all the softwares like VIM, EMACS, RUBY and the like .. 

But then how are all of these things consolidated into one GH repo ? Is there someway by which you can take these dotfiles and put them into a folder ? Or is the .gitignore file specifically written to ignore everything else except the dotfiles ? 

**CONFUSION** , you could say ! 

*Help!*
