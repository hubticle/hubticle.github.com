#nischal.sh

So , i'm too tired to do the whole git thingie so i'm going to write a script for it . And it is going to be named after a real BADA AADMI that i know , called Nischal .. So just putting up the shell script here in case i lose the copy sometime later

	#!/bin/bash

	git add .
	git commit -a
	git pull origin master
	git push origin master

This is *probably* the first ever working shell script that i have written (ofc , it assumes that it works)
